# MiQu
## _As Light Weight as it gets_
THIS PROJECT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED OUTSIDE OF _MiQu Project Template_

MiQu is a light weight framework with a lot of features that can be easily enabled/disabled via config file. Every application has it's needs, and I kept that in mind while designing the framework.

## How to use

`composer install globalsoft/miqu`
